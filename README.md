# PrivateTalk

PrivateTalk is a lightweight, open-source tool for sending encrypted, self-destructing messages. Focused on maximum privacy, transparency, and auditability, PrivateTalk never stores messages in plain text or requires any registration.

## Features

- **Client-side encryption:** Messages are encrypted in your browser (AES-GCM), never on the server.
- **One-time access:** Messages can only be read once; they're destroyed immediately after being viewed.
- **Optional extra password:** Add a second password for double protection (optional).
- **Custom expiration:** Define automatic expiration (in hours or days) or a specific time window ("time-lock").
- **No tracking:** No cookies, logs, or tracking of any kind. No analytics scripts.
- **No database:** All data is stored in simple flat files for maximum transparency and easy self-hosting.
- **Public logs:** Self-destruction and expiration logs are available for independent verification (SHA-256 hashes).
- **Minimalist UI:** Responsive design for desktop and mobile, with a focus on usability.
- **Local dashboard:** Easily track and manually destroy your own messages by uploading your log file (no server-side tracking).
- **True One-Time Read:** Messages are only destroyed after a successful decryption with the correct key. Invalid attempts do NOT erase or reveal the message.
- **Prevents "premature" destruction:** Unlike most similar services, messages are NOT deleted if someone tries to access them with an invalid or wrong key.

**Notes:**
- **PrivateTalk** is radically privacy-focused: there is no account system, and no emails, phone numbers, or notifications are ever collected or sent.
- **No registration** means no user data to leak, hack, or misuse‚Äîmaximum anonymity for all users.
- **No notifications** (email/SMS) because the platform never stores any contact information; all control remains with the sender and recipient.
- Only PrivateTalk encrypts *everything* on the client side, never storing readable content on the server.
- Public logs allow anyone to independently verify when a message was destroyed or expired.
- **Safe Deletion:** Messages are only deleted when correctly decrypted. Wrong key attempts do not erase your message.

*This table is periodically reviewed; let us know if you spot an inaccuracy or want a service added!*


## How It Works

1. **Write your message.**
2. **Share the generated link** (or split the link and key for maximum privacy).
3. **The message can only be read once.** After it's read or the expiration time passes, the message is destroyed forever.


## Security

- All encryption happens in your browser, using strong algorithms (AES-GCM).
- The server never sees your plaintext message or your encryption keys.
- You may optionally add an extra password for enhanced security.
- No data is tracked or shared; there are no analytics, cookies, or third-party code.
- Self-destruction and expiration hashes are public for maximum auditability.
- Each message uses a unique, random PBKDF2 salt and a random IV (nonce), both generated in the browser. This prevents rainbow table attacks, even if the same passphrase is reused across different messages.
- The default encryption is AES-GCM 256-bit (can be changed to 128-bit if needed).
- All JavaScript and CSS are served from external files only, with strict Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options headers enforced, ensuring robust browser-side protection against code injection and clickjacking.

PrivateTalk undergoes periodic security testing and code review. See [SECURITY-TESTS.md](SECURITY-TESTS.md) for a full report and historical results of manual and automated security testing.
