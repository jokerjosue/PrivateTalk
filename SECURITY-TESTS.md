## Test #1: XSS Audit with XSStrike (June 2025)

**Scope:** Full code review and automated testing with XSStrike v3.1.5.

**Key points checked:**
- All user inputs validated and/or encrypted before server-side processing.
- `msg` (message) accepted only as base64; `id` (message ID) sanitized to hex.
- No dynamic content inserted via `innerHTML` or unsanitized DOM manipulation.
- All output uses `textContent` for display.

**Test Results:**

> ```

> Checking for DOM vulnerabilities
> Potentially vulnerable objects found
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> 192 let url = location.origin + *location.pathname* + '?id=' + id + '#' + enc.key;
> 215 const url = new URL(*location.href*);
> 217 let key = *location.hash*.replace('#','');
> 258 if (history.pushState) history.pushState({}, '', *location.pathname*);
> 259 else *location.hash* = '';
> 268 *setTimeout*(()=>{ button.textContent = original; }, 1200);
> 272 const url = new URL(*location.href*);
> 274 let key = *location.hash*.replace('#','');
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> WAF Status: Offline
> Testing parameter: id
> No reflection found
> ```

**Conclusion:**  
No reflected or stored XSS vulnerabilities detected. All flagged JS objects were reviewed and confirmed safe (handled as `textContent`).
